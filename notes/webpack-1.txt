## WEBPACK
- a code buldler
- transpiling with babel
- tree shaking (elimination of dead code)
- minification
- asset management
- and many more

- webpack by default looks for an src folder

## INSTALL WEBPACK AND CLI
npm i -D webpack webpack-cli (for webpack commands)
npm i -D html-webpack-plugin html-loader (for webpack to include html)
npm i -D webpack-dev-server

# PACKAGE JSON
"scripts": {
    "build": "webpack",
    "start:dev": webpack-dev-server"
}

# RUN BUILD
direct: webpack
script: npm run build

WORKFLOW
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# INITIALIZE NPM
npm init-y

# INSTALL WEBPACK
npm i -D webpack webpack-cli

# BUNDLE FILES
npx webpack
* WITHOUT CONFIGURATION
- all unused code will be automatically removed by webpack
- all js files will be bundled into main.js
- everything will be optimized
- some variables will be removed and direct input into the function

# PUT WEBPACK COMMAND TO SCRIPT
- instead of running npx webpack
- put it inside the package json script
"scripts": {
    "build": "webpack"
}

## NOTES
- files should be on the src folder (default)
- it best practice to put webpack command on JSON script
